#### Description: 

This project is a full stack web application that uses Python with Flask and SQL Alchemy.

The purpose of this web application is for users to be able to view graphal breakdowns of how much MLM distributors earn. Administrators are able to upload MLM income data using a csv file, end users can then view this data graphically.

The visualizations were generated using chart.js, and show the median and/or average income at each level of the MLM. The percentage of disrtibutors at each level is also shown.
